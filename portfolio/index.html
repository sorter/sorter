     EasyTag is a cloud-based software which offers businesses a unified 
     perspective of the current status of any inbound or outbound order. At the
     core of EasyTag is a system driven by tagging virtually everything including
     shipments, invoices, purchases orders and merchandise. By merely scanning 
     these tags, company members are able to efortlessly log their progress on 
     filling any given orders. Behind the screens, EasyTag has a robust network
     of backend services which monitor and analyze the state of its user's orders.

     At EasyTag my core responsibilities involve driving feature development and
     assuring availability as well as reliability of our service's cloud backend
     infastructure. Our services are deployed primarily on Linux-based servers
     and are distributed on the Amazon Web Services platform. In addition to our
     server-side offerings, I have also driven development of the native EasyTag
     Android client as well as the web-application offering.

    Since its conception, I have carrier out all of Fathom's technical endeavours. This 
    involved writing a customized ecommerce solution to facilitate online sales of tangible
    as well as non-tangible goods. 
    The proprietor of Fathom made it a top priority for the company to
    utilize free and open source technologies to deploy their services online. As such, I was
    tasked with deploying several Linux servers to store the databases, website, enterprise
    email accounts as well as their  online shop.
