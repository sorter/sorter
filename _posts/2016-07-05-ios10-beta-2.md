Today Apple has released the second iteration of their public beta for iOS 10.
In case you weren't aware, the current stable version of iOS (which powers
iPads and iPhones) is iOS 9. Ten is scheduled for release late in summer '16

Reception is mixed. It's been suggested that iOS 10 represents a failure to
innovate and if you think innovation means that a thing needs to look different
then you may agree. Indeed if you compare some of the look and feel of iOS 9
and 10 at a glance it would seem that little has changed. Yet, upon
closer inspection you might notice that nothing is the same. 

My summary is that iOS 10 adds a lot of functionality to iOS
devices and this alone isn't necessarily a good thing. But it seems that
although now a lot more can be achieved with iOS10, it takes a lot less effort
to get it done. Moreover, a lot of features that were already present on iOS
are just a heck of a lot easier to use now.

In this post I want to hilight just two features: raise to wake and 
iMessage developer support. 

The coolest iOS 10 feature i've noticed is also the most subtle. It's easy to 
overlook, it's nothing special and yet when I point it out to other beta
testers they're blown away. Apple calls it raise to wake. Whenever I reach for 
my iPhone to look at it, it wakes up and shows me the notification screen. 
The closest thing already on the market that have anything close to this are
those magnetic case covers that can detect when the screen is visible. But this
is completely different, if I wake from sleep or just reach for my phone or
pull it out of my pocket, the screen comes to life. When I put the phone down,
it goes back to sleep. Elegantly simple and the way things should be.

The next noticeable innovation has much broader impacts than "raise to wake".
With iOS 10 Apple will be rolling out new iMessage access for devs. Developers
will now have the option of integrating with iMessage and presenting custom
interfaces into their apps from directly within the Messages app. Hence users
can access apps without needing to leave Mssages. THis is intended to allow
users to conveniently share content, edit photos, play games, send payments and
collaborate in brand new ways. 

A simple way to visualize the impact iMessage Apps wil have is this: have you
ever been doing something in another app and you just needed to send a 
message to somebody related to the thing you were doing in that other app? Well
if that workflow occurs frequently enough then you ought to be able to do it
right from within iMessage. 

There certainly were other releases and in fact "raise to wake" wasn't even part
of beta II but these are the things I wanted to comment on the most.
