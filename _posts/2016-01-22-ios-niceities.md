title: iOS Niceities Part 1 - Notify

This will be part 1 in an N-part series of posts about some niceities I've
noticed within the iOS platform. Before I'm inevitably labeled an iOS/Apple
product fanboy, allow me to offer this: Each platform has its benefits and 
drawbacks. In many ways iOS is inferior to its Android rival. Android is
ubiquitous, it represents much more than iOS with respect to serving as a
complete OS. A basic example of this is established in a 
[report](http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_os-ww-monthly-201601-201601-map) 
by StatCounter.com that
  indicated by January 2016 virtually all countries in the world have
    gone Android-majority with only 
  a few minor exceptions. This doesn't include the many tablet-based and
    embedded platforms that have adopted Android. In many ways it's clear that Android is the superior
    OS.

I've also heard it argued that the iOS platform
doesn't offer anywhere near the customization abilities of Android.
Often cited examples of this include customization of the 
[launcher app](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Launchers&c=apps&docType=1&sp=CAFiCwoJTGF1bmNoZXJzegUYAMABAooBAggB%3AS%3AANO1ljLEjxw&hl=en), 
[lock screen]
(https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Lock%20Screen&c=apps&hl=en),
[notifications]
(https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Notifications&c=apps&hl=en), 
LED notification lights and so forth.
Although there's probably some truth to this claim, it's also my belief that 
too many 
customization options can be a hindrance and a disservice to a mobile OS. 
The average mobile phone user isn't an
expert on human-machine interactions, they don't know the best ways in which
to customize their notification LED or [how many minutes apart they want their
LED to pulse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rageconsulting.android.lightflow&hl=en). I'm sure you can imagine how quickly this muck
of customization options can contribute to a nasty mess of a mobile phone.

Simply put, sometimes Android's myriad of customization options are overwhelming
and they degrade from the overall mobile exeprience. One key example of this
lies within Android's lack of centralization when it comes to controling 
notification settings. In contrast, iOS offers a core notification settings
feature as a part of the OS itself. This serves to restore control over
the intrusiveness of notifications to the user in a pleasant and user-friendly
way. The iOS notification centre settings are built into the core of the
system's internals. It manage and enforces notification policies for all 
installed apps.


iOS users are given control over:

1. whether to disable or enable notifications for the app altogether
2. if the notification appears in the notification centre
3. whether there will be a badge icon for that app on the user's homescreen
4. whether or not notifications will appear on the lock screen


This centralized method of control over notifications offers user's a central
authority to control how intrusive they desire their mobile phones to be. It
ensures that a user can go to one place to conclusively determine where, when
and how they are to be notified and this, my dear readers, is one step closer
to the revered technological zen we all seek
