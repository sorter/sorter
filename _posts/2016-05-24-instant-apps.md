On May 18th, day one of Google's annual dev. conference 
[Google I/O](https://events.google.com/io2016/), among the many product demos 
was the announcement of the next major
disruptor in the mobile application market: 
[Instant Apps](https://developer.android.com/topic/instant-apps/index.html).

The idea behind it is a test drive for apps. When visitng a webpage, 
if an instant app is available for that page then your Android mobile phone will
load that app instead of the webpage. It's worth noting that the
instant app will load as fast, if not faster than the webpage it replaces.

For example, when you visit a URL to pay for a parking space, 
instead of a clanky webpage payment interface, you're able to use
the city parking app to pay without the need to install
any apps or without knowing you were using an app altogether.

To name another benefit of adopting instant apps for your platform, 
 consisder that users can now get a taste of your company's unique app features
without the need to commit to taking up precious device storage space. 
Also, since 
Instant Apps run within a secure sandbox, there are far fewer security risks 
when using an instant app.

It's obvious to anybody who has done their research that native apps
always offer a more reliable user experience, if designed
correctly. But the trouble with apps was that you had to do the added work of 
searching for, downloading 
and installing
the app (if it even exists).

No more: the full potential of your phone is utilized to access the
websites you need the most, saving you time, effort and a helluva lot of 
frustration.
