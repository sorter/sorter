title: Web Framework Reviews 
cover: cover.jpg

In this post I intend to lay some scaffolding for a series of blog posts
which will explore the functionality and performance of a few distinct
web frameworks.

Web frameworks and development libraries are something which tend to 
repetitively come up in my work. Any project which goes beyond a trivial static 
website (and even then sometimes) tends to lend itself to the utilization of
some web development framework or lib.

Like all things in life, each web framework has its own benefits and drawbacks.
They each have their own personalities and quirks which distinguish them from 
their peers. Further, there doesn't seem to be any end in sight when it
comes to the development of new frameworks. Thanks to rapidly evolving
technologies, standards and protocols that are continuously being made 
available 
within the market, developers seem to have an insatiable thirst for providing
new web frameworks.

My purpose here is to identify a set of criteria which I'll use to evaluate
each framework I come across that I deem interesting or important. 
This criteria 
will be made up of characteristics that I feel have a significant direct impact
on the web development process.

At this time I'm considering looking at the following aspects (expect this to 
grow):

1. Setup time

    How long does it take to get a development environment up and running,
    also can this be easily done across platforms?

2. Development Environment

    What's the dev environment like and is it intuitive to utilize? Also,
    does it keep out of your way or is it constantly providing roadblocks? 

3. Licensing

    What can I legally do with this web framework?

4. Deployment

    What does it take to push from development to production?

5. Difficulty Level

    Does this framework require a tremendous amount of specific requisite
    knowledge to do something useful or is it easy from anyone with a web
    development background jump right in?

6. Support

    How well maintained is the project? Is the develoment community open? Also,
    how long has it been around for?

7. Adaptability

    Is the framework constantly adapting to changing standards or does it 
    remain immune to change? Also, is this a bad thing in the context of
    this specific framework?

8. Security

    Is the platform relatively immune from known attack vectors? Does it
    actively seek to mitigate the threat of abuse?

9. Development Iteration Cycle

    How easy is it to use the given framework to iterate on a new idea? Can
    I easily take an idea from concept to implementation in a reasonable
    amount of time?

10. Scalability

    So the website is up and running, but, oh look: We've been featured on 
    reddit. Will I be able to scale this framework out to tens of hundreds
    of thousands of users? And if so, what does that entail?

Hopefully, in comparing web frameworks by these
characteristics, I'll be able to clarify what is and isn't going to affect
the outcome of a given web development project with respect to the web framework
itself. I encourage the reader to bear in mind that what I identify in this 
series is merely correlated to my very limited experience and use cases and 
that nothing is set in stone. What makes or breaks a framework for me might
starkly contrast what you hold to be important considerations. 
To readers that feel this way
I encourage you to participate in the conversation and to lend me your 
perspective.
