Advances in the fields of software & hardware within the past few years have
given rise to the integration of smart-features within many mainstream
automobiles, some include:


1. Keyless entry
2. Completely software-controlled interfaces for heating, cooling, diagnostics, power features etc.
3. GM's On-Star
4. Self-parking systems
5. Remote-Start etc. etc.

These features which were once only considered feasible for luxury vehicle lines are now becomming prevalent among all tiers of vechicles in both the economy and luxury markets. These features are undoubtedly enhancing the safety, security, convenience, value and utility of modern cars and all around appear to be a "good thing" for consumers at large.

However, adding all these moving parts and sofware-backed components can in many cases increase the available attack surface for attackers that can leverage in order to steal, damage or otherwise exploit our personal property or safety.

Another maor consideration into the automotive threat model is the increaseing number of car models which are designed to establish and maintain some form of internet connection. In recent history we've seen an increasing number of new exploits discovered from the security research community which demonstrate that automobiles which maintain an active internet connection no long require attackers
to be within close physical proximity of their target. Instead the attackers
are able to carryout the delivery and execution of their exploits remotely from anywhere on the planet.
